<header>Reconnecting With The Power Of Natural 	Voice
</header>
<p>I want to reconnect with the power of my natural,authentic voice.</P>
<P>Freeing my natural voice is a path that leads to reconnecting with my authentic self,which is what been to do for more than two decades living in the united states.</p>
<p>I have tried cognitive behaviorial therapy,overcoming social anxiety ta,taking voice lesson,singing,lessons,advanced public speaking,communication and acting classes,dating,andmeetups,festivals,socialclubs none got me the results and i was seeking.</P>
<p>Now that i am experiting with openingup my natural voice and my style of spealking i;ve lost have been searching foer all these years.</p>
<p>I have accumulated great wisdom from the journey of healing and transformation with my ntural voice,gentle and loving and i believing how to do that will be of great value to other people.</p>
<p>By making youtube video i will be able to documrent my own process of reconnecting with my voice because i am still in the process of regaining my voice.</p>
<p>As iam became more comfortable with my own voice i am hoping to connect with people beyond words with the kind of energy that will speak to people on a soul level love,and beauty of creation and speak with the energy that will communicate all these will communicate all these values and speak with the energy that will communicate all these values i want to embody and share.</p>
